# LIY - Learn It Yourself

## Aim and Motivation

The aim of this project is to help beginner developers and students who are trying to learn things by themselves, by providing resources to help and guide them in this journey of self-learning.

## About this repository

This repository is designed as an archive which contains links to courses,video playlists, books and other resources for various programming languages, frameworks and other related technologies. Currently, resources are available only for Java but I intend to expand this in future.
